    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definitions\n",
    "**Admiration** of an item represents how much an item is liked by our userbase. We will find $V$ by combining the features with carefully chosen coefficients. These coefficients should reflect our beliefs about how important a particular feature should be when determining the admiration level of an item.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Completeness** of an item represents how much content an item contains. This is an important consideration for popularity since it allows us to show better items.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Popularity score** of an item represents how likely it is that, this item will be one that a user will prefer over some other item.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trending score** adds an additional factor over popularity, which is the time since the item's creation. By using this information, we will show fresh items with good content.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methods\n",
    "When computing popularity, we take $log$ of admiration level. This relies on the following reasoning: When an item gets admired by some users, its popularity number increases. This results in the item in consideration to be seen by more users, which in turn increases the item's chances of getting more views, favourites, etc. Hence, it makes sense to give equal value to the first 10 comments, and the next 100 comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, apart from their completeness, each item starts on equal grounds. However, compared with older items, we give higher popularity number to new items to make them more likely to be seen by our users. When a certain amount of time passes (when $T_s > K$), we stop changing the item's popularity with respect to its creation time, and solely rely on its intrinsic and popular value."
